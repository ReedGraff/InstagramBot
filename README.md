# InstagramBot
Hey, here is some work I have done using the Python libraries Instabot and Selenium. Feel free to use any of the code from my project!

- I am not responsible for any harm or loss of account by using this repository
- Be warned that Instagram may delete or suspend your account, as Instagram is able to detect bots

If you would like to make your own Instagram bot follow the following instructions:
1. Download this repository
2. Open the index.py file in your favorite text editor. (You may use notepad)
3. Replace the two variables ("YOURUSERNAME" and "YOURPASSWORD") with the username and password that you would like to use... Do not worry, this is stored locally on your device... It is not being sent anywhere.
4. Run the "index.py" file however you would like. Personally, I run my files through the command line.
5. It should be working! If you have any questions email me at Rangergraff@gmail.com
